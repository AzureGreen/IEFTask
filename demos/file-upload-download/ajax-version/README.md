ajax-version
==============

Introduction
-------------
This is a demo to upload file using ajax with js and php, I just used a plug-in(see it in `referenced project(s)`) to achieve the goal. This plug-in simulate form with `method:post` and `enctype:multipart/form-data` in ajax.


Requirements
--------------------
- jquery 3.2.1+
- jquery.ajaxfileupload.js


Reference Project(s)
--------------------
- `AjaxFileUpload`
 - https://github.com/davgothic/AjaxFileUpload

I roughly referenced its code, and I just modify it with a picture display in the center of browser :simple_smile: .
